Custom cursors indeed add a unique and fun element to user interfaces, especially on larger screens. As you mentioned, they can contribute to branding and enhance the user experience. Implementing these cursor effects typically involves a combination of CSS and JavaScript.<br>
For instance, you can change the cursor's appearance on your webpage by using the CSS cursor property with a built-in cursor type or a custom image.<br>
Hello everyone! In this video, you are going to learn how to create an animated cursor for a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript on mouse move, mouse out, and mouse stopped. On the mouse move event, the cursor animation element will follow the cursor pointer everywhere it moves on the page. On the mouse out event, when the mouse pointer is out from the page the cursor animation will hide from the page. And also on the mouse stopped function, when the mouse pointer stopped on the page the cursor will hide from the page. Let's see how to create this animated cursor effect.<br>
First, create the index.html file and style.css file. After you created those files then start the HTML part of the cursor element in the index.html file. When the HTML part is complete, to start the styling part with the cursor element animation link the style.css file to the index.html file in between <head></head> tags. Then go to the style.css file and do the styling part of the cursor element animation as you can see in the video. After the styling part complete then go to the index.html file for the javascript part. In the index.html file before the body close tag open <script></script> tags and complete the javascript part inside that tags as you can see in the video. So that's all. Hope this video will be helpful to create awesome cursor effects on a website.<br>
